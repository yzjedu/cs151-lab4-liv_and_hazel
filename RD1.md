**What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?**
The use while statements, loops, writing algorithms and strings.

**What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?**

First Liv and I read the read me file and talked about how to solve the problem. Afterwords, we worked on the algorithm, then the Excel sheet, and then the code.

**What were the Key concepts explored?**
We deepened our understanding of pair programming, writing algorithms, while loops, and strings.

**Did your results match what you expected to get?**
Yes, eventually, after a few hiccups with the code, the results were the same as our test cases.

**Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?**
Yes, for the package type, we tested invalid inputs and the code simply asks the user to try again.

**What challenges did you encounter?**
For a while, we could not get the while loop to work. Everything was coming back as true. We then realized that we had put "or" rather than "and"
After we corrected it, everything else went smoothly.

**How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?**
1. Think before Programming: We read the read me file, completed our algorithm, and completed our test cases before starting to program.
2. Program is the embodiment of the algorithm: Our code follows our algorithm
3. Improve through practice: We improved our pair programming / coding skills by completing this lab.


**Did you overcome them, and how?**
Yes, after looking back on our notes we were able to correct the statement to use "and" instead of "or"

**Any key takeaways?**
Understanding True / False statements is super important when coding. 

**Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?**
Yes I do. I feel much more comfortable with strings, loops, and pair programming.

**What was it like working with your partner?**
It was good, we communicated well together and she is very nice.
